A store management system written in C# using WPF (The repository also features a WinForms application based on an older version of the code base). (.NET Framework). The project uses a remote MYSQL database.

The application features a multi-warehouse/department management system, employee and warehouse items management, automatic employee workshift generation based on user preferences with ability to override and a statistics view. Additionally, a website was developed for easy access to employee workshift schedule as well as the ability to change general personal data.

Around the middle of the coursework project, most of the code base was refactored and transferred to a WPF application that utilizes the MVVM design pattern.
